# Dow Jones Investigation 
An investment strategy called 'Sell in May and go away' is based on the hypothesis that stock market prices perform weaker between May and October than during all other months. This project will investigate and test whether there are monthly differences using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as an indicator of stock market trends (starting from 1896). However, this project will be focusing more on data wrangling than high-level statistics.

# Findings
Besides focusing on the patterns on the stock market, there were small gaps in data found. This was on 28 June 1914 because the New York Stock Exchange closed due to WW1 breaking out. A plot of the relative percentage change of the Dow Jones was plotted against a function of time (plot shown below) and it was found that the largest increase in the history of Dow Jones was in April 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt took office as president (March 1933). The increase can be attributed to the announcement of a new deal with would bring significant banking and economic reforms (more detail in the html file). And slowly, the financial markets started recovery in April 1933, which brought the largest increase in the history of Dow Jones (from this data) in April 1933.

Overall, the data showed that the investment strategy 'Sell in may and go away' may not always be viable as it seems that the best time to buy appears to be at the end of September and the best time to sell is at the end of December.
